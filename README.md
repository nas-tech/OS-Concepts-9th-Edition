# OS-Concepts-9th-Edition
Silberchatz, Galvin and Gagne OS Concepts 9th Edition

The ninth edition of Operating System Concepts continues to evolve to provide a solid theoretical foundation for understanding operating systems. This edition has been updated with more extensive coverage of the most current topics and applications, improved conceptual coverage and additional content to bridge the gap between concepts and actual implementations. A new design allows for easier navigation and enhances reader motivation. Additional end–of–chapter, exercises, review questions, and programming exercises help to further reinforce important concepts. WileyPLUS, including a test bank, self–check exercises, and a student solutions manual, is also part of the comprehensive support package.
